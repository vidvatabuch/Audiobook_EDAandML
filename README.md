# Audiobook_EDAandML
Exploratory data analysis on audio book app customer data and ML algorithm to predict whether customer would buy again from the again.

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to get an insight into the purchase data of customers of an Audiobook app. Exploratory analysis would help to know how many like how many customers rated, reviewed and bought number of books.
Further more, it aims to predict whether customer would buy from the app or not which would help to know what target customers to focus the marketing to.

## Project Description
Audiobook EDA
Showcases the categorical data in various charts. Answers the questions such as number of audiobooks purchased, total amount, number of minutes listened, Number of reviews and ratings, Support requests made by the customers.

Audiobook Tensorflow
Provides the Machine Learning solution to the classification problem of whether the customer will buy from the app or not by studying and performing operations on the available dataset

This particular file has to be run in kernel that has tensorflow installed.(Different virtual environmenet prefered)
